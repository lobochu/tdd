#tdd


Feature:

As a Hotel servent, when I find the time diaplyed on hotel clocks(e.g Beijin, London, Sydney, Mocscow and New York) 
which displayed world time not correct, I can update time based on my watch, the system will automatically update world time clock
on the wall. The application will help to based on my input to update all clocks accordlinglly.

Rule:
Time differences between UTC time
Geigin, London, Moscow, Sydney, New York
+8    , 0,    , +4    , +10   , -5
