#tdd


Feature:

As a Hotel servent, when I find the time diaplyed on hotel clocks(e.g Beijin, London, Sydney, Mocscow and New York) 
for world time  not correct, I can update time based on my watch, the system will automatically update world time clock
on the wall.

Rule:
Time differences between UTC time
Geigin, London, Moscow, Sydney, New York
+8    , 0,    , +4    , +10   , -5
